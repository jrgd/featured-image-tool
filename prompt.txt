# PROMPT

this an html/css page + js
this tool will create a high resolution image based on data input on the page; both the data and the image are visible
user will input a maximum of 4 line of text
the tool will insert the text with a custom font
one line at atime, each line at a random angle
without the text overlapping
there a couple of controls on the left hand side:
- image size in pixel (w / h)
- text strings input (x4, one per line of text)
- each line of text gets a random angle, that is editable
- text color; clicking on the color swatch let's you edit it hls gradients
- background-color
- font-size (1 size fits all for now)
the image is then save-able; i imagine this would be a canvas image generated on the client side (js); there should be no server-side ops
interface should be minimalist (10px font size, monospace, B/W, no shadow, 1px solid black border, 5px margin)


# REFINING / QUESTIONS

Questions
1. Should the angle inputs auto-update with random values when the page loads, or only when user clicks a "Generate" button?
2. For the HLS color picker - do you want a custom gradient selector, or use <input type="color"> with JS to convert to HSL?
3. Should there be a "Randomize Positions" button to re-roll text placements without changing text/angles?


Answers
1. generate button for each field; teh field remain manually editable
2. custom gradient selector sounds great; would it be possible to change the gradient? like another gradient or even drop an image altogether to pick color from
3. yes; we shoudl have for each line x,y input for position that can be randomized like the angle
nb: we should ensure there is no text overlap


Questions
1. For the gradient - should the image upload replace the gradient entirely, or overlay the gradient on top of the image?
2. How should the overlap warning be displayed? Red border on the affected line inputs? A visual overlay on the canvas?
3. For x/y randomization - should it randomize within the full canvas, or stay within some padding from edges?

Answers
1. if we use an image we replace the gradient
2. no need for warning; i assume user have eyes and will use these
3. text shoudl remain inside the surface of the image




# PLAN 

Final Plan: Featured Image Tool
File Structure
Single HTML file: index.html (embedded CSS/JS)
Layout
- Left panel: Controls (~320px)
- Right panel: Canvas preview (responsive, maintains aspect ratio)
- All styling: 10px monospace, B/W, 1px solid black border, 5px margin
Controls
Image Settings
- Width / Height (px) - default 1200×630
- Font Size (px) - default 48
- Background: Solid color / Gradient / Image upload
Background Options
- Type dropdown: Solid | Linear Gradient | Radial Gradient | Image
- Color 1 (HSL picker) - primary color
- Color 2 (HSL picker) - secondary color (for gradients)
- Direction slider (0-360°) - for linear gradients
- Image upload button - replaces background entirely
Per-Line Controls (×4)
- Text input
- X position (px) - editable + 🎲 randomize button
- Y position (px) - editable + 🎲 randomize button  
- Angle (-180° to 180°) - editable + 🎲 randomize button
- Text Color (HSL picker)
HSL Picker UI
- Click color swatch → opens inline HSL sliders (H: 0-360, S: 0-100%, L: 0-100%)
- Live preview update
Randomization
- Each 🎲 button randomizes that specific field
- X/Y: random position ensuring text stays within canvas bounds (with padding)
- Angle: random angle between -180° and 180°
Rendering
- Canvas draws background (color/gradient/image)
- For each text line:
  - Save context → translate to (x,y) → rotate → draw text → restore
- Anti-aliased, high-resolution output
Save/Download
- Canvas draggable to desktop
- Right-click "Save Image As..."
